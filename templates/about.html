  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <main>
    <p>
      At CafeSpotter, we believe finding the perfect cafe shouldn't be left to
      chance. We're passionate about connecting coffee lovers, remote workers,
      and social butterflies with cafes that perfectly match their needs -
      whether that's reliable WiFi for a day of work, plenty of power outlets
      for your devices, or clean restroom facilities.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      CafeSpotter was born from frustration. Our founder, a remote worker, spent
      countless hours searching for cafes with reliable internet and power
      outlets, only to arrive and find neither available. After one too many
      disappointing experiences, the idea for a comprehensive cafe database was
      born. Starting in 2023 with just 50 cafe listings in our local city, we've
      grown to feature over 5,000 verified locations across the country, with
      user contributions adding more daily.
